We propose S‚Å¥M, a semi-supervised instance segmentation framework that effectively leverages capabilities of Segment Anything Model (SAM) through three key components: structural distillation, pseudo-label refinement, and specialized data augmentation. 

## üîß Installation

Please follow [installation](install.md).

## üíæ Prepare Datasets

Please follow [dataset preperation](./tools/datasets/README.md).

## üî• Model Training 

Training is split into two consecutive steps. We provide shell scripts for each stage:

- `train_teacher.sh`: Pre-train the teacher model
- `train_student.sh`: Train the semi-supervised student model. Please note that this stage requires a minimum of 2 GPUs.


### Example on Cityscapes
```bash
# First train teacher model
bash ./scripts/cityscapes/train_teacher.sh [NUM_GPUS] [PERCENTAGE] 

# After completing pre-training teacher model, train student model 
bash ./scripts/cityscapes/train_student.sh [NUM_GPUS] [PERCENTAGE] [TEACHER_CKPT]

# evaluation
bash ./scripts/cityscapes/val.sh [NUM_GPUS] [TEACHER_CKPT] SSL.TRAIN_SSL False SSL.EVAL_WHO TEACHER
bash ./scripts/cityscapes/val.sh [NUM_GPUS] [STUDENT_CKPT] SSL.TRAIN_SSL True SSL.EVAL_WHO STUDENT
```
_We want to note that, in case the of Cityscapes, teacher pre-training is configured to run on 2√ó RTX 3090 GPUs,
and semi-supervised student training is configured to run on 4√ó RTX 3090 GPUs by default._

### Example on COCO
```bash
bash ./scripts/coco/train_teacher.sh [NUM_GPUS] [PERCENTAGE] 

# After completing pre-training teacher model, train student model 
bash ./scripts/coco/train_student.sh [NUM_GPUS] [PERCENTAGE] [TEACHER_CKPT]

# evaluation
bash ./scripts/coco/val.sh [NUM_GPUS] [TEACHER_CKPT] SSL.TRAIN_SSL False SSL.EVAL_WHO TEACHER
bash ./scripts/coco/val.sh [NUM_GPUS] [STUDENT_CKPT] SSL.TRAIN_SSL True SSL.EVAL_WHO STUDENT
```
_For the COCO dataset, teacher pre-training is configured to run on 2√ó RTX A6000 GPUs,
and semi-supervised student training is configured to run on 4√ó RTX A6000 GPUs by default._

## Model weights
We provide pre-trained teacher and student model checkpoints for Cityscapes and COCO.
